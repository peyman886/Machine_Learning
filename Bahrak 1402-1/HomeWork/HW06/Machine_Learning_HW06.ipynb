        "\n",
        "**DBSCAN**, which stands for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, is a clustering algorithm used in machine learning and data mining. Unlike k-means, DBSCAN does not require the user to specify the number of clusters beforehand and can identify clusters of arbitrary shapes. It is particularly effective in discovering clusters in data with varying densities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the main concepts associated with DBSCAN:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Core Points:**\n",
        "A data point is considered a core point if there are at least a specified number of data points (minPts) within a certain radius (eps) around it, including itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Border Points:** A data point is a border point if it is within the specified radius of a core point but does not have enough neighbors to be considered a core point itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Noise:** Data points that are neither core points nor border points are considered noise. They do not belong to any cluster.\n",
        "\n",
        "The DBSCAN algorithm works as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Select a Random Unvisited Data Point:**\n",
        "Choose a data point that has not been visited.\n",
        "2. **Expand Cluster:**\n",
        "If the chosen point is a core point, create a new cluster and expand it by adding all reachable core points (and their neighbors) to the cluster.\n",
        "3. **Repeat:**\n",
        "Continue the process until all points have been visited.\n",
        "The result is a set of clusters, each containing core points that are densely connected. Border points may be part of a cluster but are not as tightly connected as core points. Noise points are not assigned to any cluster.\n",
        "\n",
        "The DBSCAN algorithm uses two parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "**eps (ε):** A distance measure that will be used to locate the points in the neighborhood of any point. For each instance, the algorithm counts how many instances are located within a small distance ε (epsilon) from it. This region is called the instance’s ε-neighborhood.\n",
        "\n",
        "**minPts:** The minimum number of points (a threshold) clustered together for a region to be considered dense. If an instance has at least min_samples instances in its ε-neighborhood (including itself), then it is considered a core instance. In other words, core instances are those that are located in dense regions. All instances in the neighborhood of a core instance belong to the same cluster. This neighborhood may include other core instances; therefore, a long sequence of neighboring core instances forms a single cluster.\n",
        "\n",
        "Any instance that is not a core instance and does not have one in its neighborhood is considered an anomaly.\n",
